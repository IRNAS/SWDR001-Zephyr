  Semtech LR11XX LoRa radio module

compatible: "irnas,lr11xx"

include: spi-device.yaml

properties:
  pwr-en-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    required: false
    description: |
      GPIO responsible for the power of lr11xx.

  reset-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    required: true
    description: |
      GPIO connected to the NRESET pin of lr11xx.

  gps-lna-en-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    required: false
    description: |
      GPIO responsible for the power of the GPS LNA used by lr11xx.

  busy-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    required: true
    description: |
      GPIO connected to the BUSY/DIO0 pin of lr11xx.

      The BUSY line is high when lr11xx is in sleep mode,
      and ready to accept commands.
      The BUSY line is low when lr11xx is processing a command.

  event-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    required: true
    description: |
      GPIO connected to the LR_EVENT/DIO9 signal on lr11xx.
      High EVENT line indicates an event must be read from lr11xx.
      The EVENT line stays high until all events are cleared.

  lf-tx-path:
    type: int
    required: true
    enum:
      - 0
      - 1
      - 2
    description: |
      Configuration of the low power TX path placement. Selects which RF paths
      are placed and thus which paths lr11xx will use.
      Use the LR11XX_TX_PATH_* macros in lr11xx_bindings_def.h when setting
      this property.

  tcxo-supply:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
      Supply voltage of the TCXO used by lr11xx. This is the voltage that
      lr11xx will output on the VTCXO pin. Use the LR11XX_TCXO_SUPPLY_*
      macros in lr11xx_bindings_def.h when setting this property.

  tcxo-wakeup-time:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
      In milliseconds, the wakeup (or stabilization) time of the TCXO used by lr11xx.

  lf-clk:
    type: int
    required: true
    enum:
      - 0
      - 1
      - 2
    description: |
      Low frequency clock source for lr11xx. Use the LR11XX_LFCLK_* macros
      in lr11xx_bindings_def.h when setting this property.

  reg-mode:
    type: int
    required: true
    enum:
      - 0
      - 1
    description: |
      Configuration of the lr11xx regulator mode. Use the LR11XX_REG_MODE_*
      macros in lr11xx_bindings_def.h when setting this property.

  rf-sw-enable:
    type: int
    required: false
    description: |
      Configuration for enabling rf switches RFSW0 through RFSW4 (DIO5 - DIO8).

      Select RFSW/DIO pins that will be used in any of the lr11xx modes.
      If a RFSW/DIO pin is not selected it can not be used in any of the lr11xx
      modes and will be left in High-Z state.

      Valid values are: LR11XX_DIO5 - 8, representing DIO5 - DIO8 pins.
      Setting multiple pins is done with logical OR operator,
      i.e. LR11XX_DIO5 | LR11XX_DIO6.
      If none of the RFSW/DIO pins need to be enabled then do not
      set rf-sw-enable in DTS.
      For usage of the LR11XX_DIO5 - 8 macros, file lr11xx_bindings_def.h needs
      to be includes in the DTS file!

  rf-sw-standby-mode:
    type: int
    required: false
    description: |
      Configuration for selecting RFSW0 through RFSW4 (DIO5 - DIO8) pin states
      for lr1xx standby mode.

      If a RFSW/DIO pin is selected and enabled (set in rf-sw-enable), the pin
      is set high in this mode.
      If a RFSW/DIO pin is not selected, but it is enabled, the pin is set
      low.
      If a RFSW/DIO pin is not selected and not enabled it is left in HIGH-Z
      state.

  rf-sw-rx-mode:
    type: int
    required: false
    description: |
      Configuration for selecting RFSW0 through RFSW4 (DIO5 - DIO8) pin states
      for lr11xx rx mode.

      See rf-sw-standby-mode for details on the pins.

  rf-sw-tx-mode:
    type: int
    required: false
    description: |
      Configuration for selecting RFSW0 through RFSW4 (DIO5 - DIO8) pin states
      for lr11xx tx mode.

      See rf-sw-standby-mode for details on the pins.

  rf-sw-tx-hp-mode:
    type: int
    required: false

      Configuration for selecting RFSW0 through RFSW4 (DIO5 - DIO8) pin states
      for lr11xx tx hp mode.

      See rf-sw-standby-mode for details on the pins.

  rf-sw-tx-hf-mode:
    type: int

      for lr11xx tx hf mode.

      See rf-sw-standby-mode for details on the pins.

  rf-sw-wifi-mode:
    type: int
    required: false

      Configuration for selecting RFSW0 through RFSW4 (DIO5 - DIO8) pin states
      for lr11xx wifi mode.

      See rf-sw-standby-mode for details on the pins.

  rf-sw-gnss-mode:
    type: int
    required: false
    description: |
