compatible: "irnas,lr11xx"

include: spi-device.yaml

properties:
    pwr-en-gpios:
      type: phandle-array
      required: false
      description: |
        GPIO responsible for power of lr1110.

    reset-gpios:
      type: phandle-array
      required: true
      description: |
        GPIO connected to the NRESET signal on lr1110.

        This signal is active-low as interpreted by lr1110.

    gps-lna-en-gpios:
      type: phandle-array
      required: false
      description: |
        GPIO responsible for power of GPS LNA used by lr1110.

    busy-gpios:
      type: phandle-array
      required: true
      description: |
        GPIO connected to the BUSY/DIO0 signal on lr1110.

        The BUSY line is high when the device is in sleep mode, 
        and ready to accept a command. 
        The BUSY line is low when the device is processing sent command.

        This signal is active-low as interpreted by lr1110.

    event-gpios:
      type: phandle-array
      required: true
      description: |
        GPIO connected to the LR_EVENT/DIO9 signal on lr1110.
        High EVENT line indicates an event must be read from lr1110.
        The EVENT line stays high until all events are cleared.

        This signal is active-high as interpreted by lr1110.

        Select RFSW/DIO pins that will be used in any of the lr11xx modes.
        If a RFSW/DIO pin is not selected it can not be used in any of the lr11xx
        modes and will be left in High-Z state.

        Valid values are: 5,6,7,8, representing DIO5 - DIO8 pins.
        If none of the RFSW/DIO pins do not need to be enabled then do not set the
